# [SUPERFICIAL](https://github.com/apps/superficial-bot)

*A GitHub ([Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)) app that blocks and fixes superficial pull requests*

# Introduction

Code review is a tedious task. It is more frustrating to find files that only have formatting updates without a change of functionality - those are **superficial changes**. 

There are many reasons why this happens - an automatic beautifier running in IDE, forgetting to revert changes, forgotten newlines or spaces. No matter the reason, superficial update makes the code review task even harder and adds chaos to the commit log. 

**Formatting changes should only be allowed in files that have actual functionality change or be submitted in their own pr.**

## This bot will: 
1. Post status message indicating the PR contains superficial updates.
2. Post comment listing the problematic files.
3. Automatically revert to base all superficial files.

| _Post warnning comment_ | _Revert changes to files_ | 

## How does it work? 
This bot has a three-step process to determine superficial updates: 
1. Pull base and head version of the file.
2. Run [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to match the basic formatting. 
3. Parse the context to AST (abstract syntax tree) using [@babel/parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser) and compare the results. 

This gives us high accuracy since it ignores any change that doesn't affect the AST of the code. 

## Supported files
- Javascript (.js, .jsx)
- Typescript (.ts, .tsx)
- Comming soon: css
